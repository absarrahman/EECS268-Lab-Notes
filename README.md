# Setting up Git and Github

The reason why I am writing this is because many of you have faced troubles while setting up Git in your local machine.
I don't know why the lab devices behave weird while using Github cli, but then again this instruction is lengthy but
once you are used to with it then it will be easier for you to do it all by yourself.

This section will be divided into few parts.
1. Setting up SSH and connect your Github with your machine
2. Clone your project
3. Stage your changes
4. Commit your changes
